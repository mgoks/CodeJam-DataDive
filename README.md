# Water for power!

A small application written to test the following hypothesis:

"Individuals who live in coastal areas have a higher mean household income than the individuals who live far from bodies of water."

After running the tests, we observed that the pi-value was less than 0.05, thus we had to reject the null-hypothesis.
